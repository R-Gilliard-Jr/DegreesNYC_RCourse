- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following keywords is used to indicate the beginning of an if/else statement in R?
  AnswerChoices: while; if; for; switch
  CorrectAnswer: if
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "if")
  Hint: 
    Revisit the "Conditionals and their use" 
    section in Lesson 5 on if/else statements
    
- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-
    What is the output of the following code?
    
    x <- 5
    
    if (x > 0) {
    
      print("x is positive")
      
    } else {
    
      print("x is non-positive")
      
    }
  AnswerChoices: x is positive; x is non-positive; x is negative; Error variable 'x' not found
  CorrectAnswer: x is positive
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "x is positive")
  Hint: 
    Consider which of the conditions in the if/else statement
    will be true.
    
- Class: script
  Output:
    Update this script so that it subtracts the numbers
    from 1 to 10 from 100.
  AnswerTests: test_while_subtract()
  Script: while_subtract.R
  Hint: 
    Review the section while loops in Lesson 5.
    
- Class: script
  Output:
    Update this script so that the for loop combines
    the words at the same index in each of the two
    vectors fruits and colors.
  AnswerTests: test_for_vector()
  Script: for_vector.R
  Hint:
    Review the section on for loops in Lesson 5.
    
- Class: script
  Output:
    Update this script to use map to loop over all elements of the list
    provided and divide them by 10. Then, use map again to loop over
    the elements of the new list and sum them. Report your result 
    in a vector named "final_sums". For a challenge, do all of this using
    map only once.
  AnswerTests: test_map_sums()
  Script: map_sums.R
  Hint:
    Review the section on map in Lesson 5. Rather than trying to use
    map once, it might be helpful to use it twice.

    The following question is a challenge question. If you are not interested
    in trying it, you can type 'bye()' to exit the course now.
    
- Class: script
  Output:
    Create a function which generates a data frame from a single vector.
    The data frame should have 5 columns and 20 rows. The columns should have
    only numeric data and they should be labeled V1 through V5. The first column
    should be equivalent to the original vector, but subsequent columns should be equal 
    to the first column multiplied by 2, 3, 4 etc. Some code has been provided to get you
    started.
  AnswerTests: test_challenge()
  Script: challenge.R
  Hint:
    Remember that in addition to looping over the elements of some vector, you can
    loop over a sequence of numbers by using seq(). Consider first creating a list
    and then converting that list into a data frame. Also, you can name the elements 
    of a list using the following syntax - list(name1 = value1, name2 = value2)
