- Class: text
  Output: 
    Each question in this lesson will ask you to write a function on your own.
    
- Class: script
  Output:
    Write a function that multiplies any number or vector provided by 5.
  AnswerTests: test_mult5()
  Script: mult5.R
  Hint:
    Take a look at mult10 that is defined in Lesson 6. If you are really stumped,
    you can simply modify this function. Make sure you are saving your function with the correct name.

- Class: script
  Output: |-
    Write a function that doubles the length of a vector by copying all of the elements of the vector. Sort 
    the vector so that like elements are together using the `sort()` function. For example, if given the 
    following vector:
    
    c(4, 5, 6)
    
    Your function should return the following:
    
    c(4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6)
    
    Similarly if given the following:
    
    c("H", "E", "L", "L", "O")
    
    Your function should return the following:
    
    c("E", "E", "H", "H", "L", "L", "L", "L", "O", "O")
  AnswerTests: test_double_vec()
  Script: double_vec.R
  Hint:
    You can use the `c()` function and the `sort()` function to build your function. 
    Make sure you are saving your function with the correct name.
    
- Class: script
  Output: |-
    Write a function that composes a standardized response email. Your function should take four arguments
    
    1) The name of the recipient
    
    2) Any additional message you would like to include
    
    3) Your name
    
    4) Sign-off (such as "Best", "Regards", etc.)
  AnswerTests: test_email()
  Script: email.R
  Hint:
    Make sure that your arguments have the correct names. Revisit lesson 6 if you've forgotten to how to create
    arguments or set argument defaults.

- Class: script
  Output:
    Write a function that checks whether or not a given number is even.
  AnswerTests: test_even_num()
  Script: even_num.R
  Hint:
    This can be done easily using the modulo operator. Revisit lesson 2 if you've forgotten how the modulo operator
    works.
