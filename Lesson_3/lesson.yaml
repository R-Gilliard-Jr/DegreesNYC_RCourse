- Class: mult_question
  Output: 
    Which of the following commands is most commonly used for creating
    vectors?
  AnswerChoices: 
    list();array();c();vector()
  CorrectAnswer: c()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "c()")
  Hint: Review the creating vectors section of Lesson 4.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |-
    What is the output of the following code 
    
    (provide your answer as a vector)?
    
    my_vector <- c(3, 5, 7, 9)
    
    my_vector[2:3]
  CorrectAnswer: "c(5, 7)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "c(5, 7)")
  Hint: Review the section on using vectors in Lesson 4.
    Use the `c()` function to report your answer. The
    code will return the second and third elements of
    my_vector.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a vector named "scores" with 
    the following values - 85, 90, 92, 87, 89.
  CorrectAnswer: "scores <- c(85, 90, 92, 87, 89)"
  AnswerTests: expr_creates_var("scores");omnitest(correctExpr = "scores <- c(85, 90, 92, 87, 89)")
  Hint: 
    To answer this question you will need to create a variable
    called scores. Combine what you know about assignment
    and what you know about vectors.
    
- Class: text
  Output:
    You can find the length of a vector using the 
    `length()` function. Use that information
    to answer the following question. You would use
    this function by typing `length(vector_name)`.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output:
    What is the length of the vector long_vector?
    Use the `length()` function (if you are using R Studio 
    you will be able to see the length in the workspace
    browser)
  CorrectAnswer: "length(long_vector)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "length(long_vector)")
  Hint: Try `length(vector_name)`
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-
    what is the output of the following code
    
    x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
    
    y <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)
    
    z <- x + y
    
    z
  AnswerChoices:
    c(6, 8, 10, 12); c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8); 
    c(5, 6, 7, 8); c(1, 2, 3, 5);
  CorrectAnswer: "c(6, 8, 10, 12)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "c(6, 8, 10, 12)")
  Hint: 
    When summing vectors, corresponding elements in each
    vector are summed (i.e. the first element in the
    first vector is added to the first element in the
    second vector and so on).

- Class: text
  Output:
    The `max()` function finds the maximum of a vector.
    Use the `max()` function to solve the following
    question.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:
    What is the maximum value in the vector long_vector?
  CorrectAnswer: "max(long_vector)"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "max(long_vector)")
  Hint: Try max(vector_name).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |-
    What is the output of the following code
    
    a <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
    
    b <- a * 2
    
    c <- b[2:3]
    
    d <- sum(c)
    
    d
  AnswerChoices: 8;12;16;20
  CorrectAnswer: "8"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "8")
  Hint: If you are stuck, remember you can use 
    swirl::play() to try the code yourself. When you
    are done, use swirl::nxt() to resume the lesson.
